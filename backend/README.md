> **Note:**
> - The project uses two ports: one for the backend API (default: 5000, set via the PORT environment variable) and one for the frontend React app (default: 3000, set via the frontend's configuration). Make sure both are running and the ports do not conflict.
> - The root of the project also contains scripts and guides for deployment and integration, such as `setup-single-port.js`, `SINGLE_PORT_GUIDE.md`, `simple-test.js`, `test-single-port.js`, `test-submit.js`, and `working-backend.js`.
> - The `frontend/` directory contains the React frontend. See its own README or documentation for setup and usage.
> - The `client/` and `server/` directories are present but currently unused/empty.

## üîß Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+ installed
- MongoDB running (local or Atlas)
- Git

### Quick Start
1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   Update `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```env
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=5001         # Backend API port
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Frontend URL (default port 3000)
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/rakshak-expense
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
   JWT_EXPIRE=24h
   ```
   > **Note:**
   > - The backend runs on the port specified by `PORT` (default: 5001).
   > - The frontend (React app) runs on its own port (default: 3000, see `frontend/package.json` or `frontend/.env`).
   > - Ensure both servers are running and accessible to each other.

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Production Start**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
